# Book Agent - Atomic Task Implementation Plan

## Development Status & Transition

**Current Status**: ✅ **MVP Task 1 Complete (September 27, 2025)** - Core intelligent state schema extensions implemented, ready for Planning Agent

**Architecture Evolution**: Moving from basic sequential workflow to intelligent agentic system with adaptive planning, inter-agent collaboration, dynamic tool selection, and continuous learning capabilities.

## Implementation Approach

This project follows an **intelligent state-first development approach** with atomic, dependency-ordered tasks to ensure independent component testing, reliable recovery, adaptive planning, agent collaboration, and continuous learning. All workflow state and agent interactions are persisted to Supabase for debugging, recovery, and learning capabilities.
