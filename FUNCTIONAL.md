# Book Agent - Functional Specification

## Overview

The Book Agent application generates comprehensive books (30,000+ words) from minimal user prompts and optional PDF content. The system uses a single LangGraph orchestrator with dynamic parallel chapter generation to create publication-ready books with professional formatting.

## Core User Journey

### Initial Input
- **User Prompt**: 3-word minimum to full paragraph describing desired book topic
- **PDF Upload** (Optional): Text files or PDFs as base content (50MB limit)
- **File Processing**: Extract text only from PDFs using pdf-parse library

### Stage 1: Conversation & Requirements Gathering

**Objective**: Collect comprehensive book requirements through guided conversation

**Process**:
1. **Topic Clarification**
   - Analyze user prompt and extracted PDF content
   - Ask clarifying questions about subject, scope, and goals
   - Determine book purpose (educational, reference, narrative, etc.)

2. **Audience Definition**
   - Target reader demographics and expertise level
   - Age brackets if applicable
   - Prior knowledge assumptions
   - Reading context (professional, academic, casual)

3. **Author Information**
   - Author name for attribution
   - Author credentials/background (optional)

4. **Style Selection**
   - Generate 3-5 style samples based on content type and audience
   - Present samples as formatted text excerpts (200-300 words each)
   - User selects preferred style
   - Document style guidelines for consistency

5. **Content Orientation**
   - Suggest content angles to maximize reader engagement
   - Confirm approach (practical vs theoretical, comprehensive vs focused)

**Deliverable**: Complete requirements document with audience, style, and scope definitions

### Stage 2: Outline Generation

**Objective**: Create comprehensive book structure enabling independent chapter development

**Process**:
1. **Title Generation**
   - Generate 3-5 title options
   - User selects or requests alternatives
   - Finalize main title and subtitle

2. **Chapter Structure Planning**
   - Determine optimal chapter count (8-25 chapters based on content complexity)
   - Calculate target word counts per chapter (1,000-2,500 words)
   - Ensure total reaches 30,000+ word minimum

3. **Detailed Chapter Outlines**
   Each chapter outline includes:
   - **Content Overview**: 2-3 sentence summary
   - **Key Objectives**: 3-5 learning goals or coverage points
   - **Target Word Count**: Specific range based on topic complexity
   - **Dependencies**: References to other chapters or concepts
   - **Research Requirements**: External information needed

**Deliverable**: Complete book outline with chapter-by-chapter breakdown ready for parallel execution

### Stage 3: Parallel Chapter Generation

**Objective**: Generate all chapters simultaneously while maintaining consistency

**Dynamic Parallel Process**:
1. **Chapter Node Spawning**
   - LangGraph creates N parallel chapter nodes based on outline
   - Each node receives: outline, style guide, audience profile, dependencies

2. **Chapter Development** (Per Node)
   - **Research Phase**: Web research using Firecrawl for current information
   - **Content Integration**: Blend PDF content, research, and original insights
   - **Writing Phase**: Generate chapter following style and word count targets
   - **Internal Review**: Self-check for completeness and quality

3. **Cross-Chapter Coordination**
   - Shared state manages cross-references and terminology
   - Automatic dependency resolution between chapters
   - Progress tracking and status updates

**Deliverable**: Complete first draft with all chapters written in parallel

### Stage 4: Consistency & Quality Review

**Objective**: Ensure publication-quality coherence and accuracy

**Sequential Review Process**:
1. **Consistency Analysis**
   - Terminology alignment across chapters
   - Style consistency verification
   - Logical flow between chapters
   - Cross-reference validation

2. **Quality Assessment**
   - Content accuracy and factual verification
   - Grammar and spelling (US English standard)
   - Audience appropriateness
   - Comprehensive coverage of outlined topics

3. **Revision Generation**
   - Create specific revision tasks for identified issues
   - Apply revisions maintaining original chapter structure
   - Validate improvements meet quality standards

**Deliverable**: Publication-ready manuscript meeting quality standards

### Stage 5: Professional Formatting & Design

**Objective**: Create publication-ready PDF with professional presentation

**Formatting Process**:
1. **Book Layout**
   - Professional typography using React-PDF
   - Consistent heading hierarchy
   - Page numbering and headers
   - Table of contents generation

2. **Cover Design**
   - Generate front and back cover using DALL-E 3
   - Include title, author, and compelling visual design
   - Ensure covers match content theme and audience

3. **PDF Compilation**
   - Assemble complete book: front cover → contents → chapters → back cover
   - Generate final PDF for download
   - Validate PDF integrity and formatting

**Deliverable**: Professional PDF ready for distribution or publication

### Stage 6: User Review & Iterative Refinement

**Objective**: Refine book based on user feedback

**Revision Process**:
1. **Feedback Collection**
   - Present completed PDF to user
   - Collect specific feedback on content, style, or structure
   - Prioritize revision requests

2. **Targeted Revisions** (Maximum 2 rounds)
   - Apply user-requested changes
   - Maintain overall book consistency
   - Regenerate PDF with revisions

3. **Final Approval**
   - User confirms satisfaction with final version
   - Deliver final PDF and close project

**Deliverable**: User-approved final book meeting all requirements

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Robust Retry Logic
- **Transient Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
